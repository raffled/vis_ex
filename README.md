## vis_ex
The repository contains code written to demo `Knitr` and `Shiny` for
Dr. Culp.

The K-NN/Loess code from STAT 745 -- Data Mining Assignment 2 will be used as an
example.

### Knitr
The Knitr directory contains an example document written up using R
Markdown.  To run the code, open `assign2.Rmd` in RStudio and hit the
`Knit to HTML` button to render the document.

You can view a live version her:

### Shiny
The Shiny directory contains an example shiny app for viewing the
plots. To run the app, run the R command `shiny::runApp()` from inside
the directory.
